## About
Medusa is a cli tool currently for importing a json or yaml file into HashiCorp Vault.

## How to use
### Setting up Medusa
#### Config file
It's possible to create a config file for Medusa to read in your homefolder `~/.medusa/config.yaml` that looks like this
```
VAULT_ADDR: https://192.168.86.41:8201
VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY: true
VAULT_TOKEN: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
If you haven't set any environment variables, or given any parameters, this file will tell Medusa where to connect, the token to use and to `VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY` should be enabled or not.

#### Environment variables
It's also possible configure Medusa via environment variables by setting them like this:
```
export VAULT_ADDR=https://192.168.86.41:8201
export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true
export VAULT_TOKEN=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

#### Parameters
> Get help with `./medusa -h`
You can configure Medusa in the commands you run like this :
```
  -a, --address string   Address of the Vault server
  -k, --insecure         Allow insecure server connections when using SSL
  -t, --token string     Vault authentication token
```

Use them like this:
```
./medusa import secret ./test/data/import-example-1.yaml --address="https://0.0.0.0:8201" --token="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --insecure
./medusa export secret/A --address="https://0.0.0.0:8201" --token="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --format="json" --insecure
```

### Importing data
> Get help with `./medusa import -h`
Medusa import will take a [vault path] with [flags]
Example:
```
./medusa import secret ./test/data/import-example-1.yaml -a="https://0.0.0.0:8201" -t="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --insecure
2020/12/11 13:23:59 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [/A/B/E]
2020/12/11 13:23:59 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [/A/Xa/Z]
2020/12/11 13:23:59 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [/A/F/G]
2020/12/11 13:23:59 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [/A/B/C/D]
2020/12/11 13:23:59 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [/A/B/C/D/Db]


./medusa import secret/folder ./test/data/import-example-1.yaml -a="https://0.0.0.0:8201" -t="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --insecure
2020/12/11 13:25:03 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [folder/A/F/G]
2020/12/11 13:25:03 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [folder/A/B/C/D]
2020/12/11 13:25:03 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [folder/A/B/C/D/Db]
2020/12/11 13:25:03 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [folder/A/B/E]
2020/12/11 13:25:03 Secret successfully written to Vault instance on path [folder/A/Xa/Z]
```

### Exporting data
> Get help with `./medusa export -h` and yaml is the default output format
Medusa import will take a [vault path] with [flags]
Example:

```
./medusa export secret --address="https://0.0.0.0:8201" --token="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --format="yaml" --insecure
A:
  B:
    C:
      D:
        Db:
          DBa: value 1
          DBb: value 2
    E:
      Ea: value 1
      Eb: value 2
  F:
    G:
      Ga: value1
  Xa:
    Z:
      Za: value 1
      Zb: value 2
```

## Secure secret management outside Vault
Medusa will help you securely manage your secrets outside Vault.
This could for instance be as a backup of your Vault data or while your secrets are being transported between Vault instances.  
Medusa uses a hybrid encryption solution in order to keep your secrets safe.  

### Key generation
When exporting your Vault secrets using Medusa, the secrets are encrypted using the AES symmetric encryption algorithm. The 256-bit AES encryption key is randomly generated by Medusa every time the export command is being called.  
Then the AES key is encrypted by the provided RSA public key and then stored together with the encrypted secrets.  
This ensures that both the exported secrets and AES enctyption key can be transfered safely between Vault instances.  
The exported secrets and AES enctyption key can only be decrypted by a person who is in possession of the RSA private key.

The RSA key-pair can be generated by the following two commands:
``` bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 4096

# Generate public key
openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem
```

### Exporting and encrypting Vault secrets
Encrypting your Vault export is easy using Medusa. Simply add the following two flags to your command:

```
-e, --encrypt bool       Encrypt the exported Vault data [true/false]
-p, --public-key string  Location of the RSA public key
```

Use them like this:
``` bash
./medusa export kv --address="https://my-vault-server.com" --token="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --insecure --encrypt="true" --public-key="public-key.pem" --output="encrypted-vault-secrets.txt"
```

### Importing and decrypting Vault secrets
Decrypting and importing your encrypted Vault export can be done by adding the following two flags to your command:

```
-d, --decrypt bool        Decrypt the Vault data before importing [true/false]
-p, --private-key string  Location of the RSA private key
```

Use them like this:
``` bash
./medusa import kv encrypted-vault-secrets.txt --address="https://my-vault-server.com" --token="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --insecure --decrypt="true" --private-key="private-key.pem"
```
